                    <p>Maine Coon cats come from colder climate areas, which is why they have suchg long furr.
                        Nevertheless they are able to adopt to many
                        new situations, surroundings and temparatues. They are very loving and attention focused cats
                        that need additional grooming by their
                        slave to accommodate their long hair. Maine Coon cats also grow bigger than most house cats.

                    <p>Sphynx cats, often referred to as naked cats, do not have any visible furr and are easily
                        differentiated from any other
                        cat. Their personality can be described as loving but demanding -they will let you know if there
                        is anything, their servant can
                        do to make their lives better - often a blanket or sweater since without furr, in colder
                        climates they are often cold. Their way
                        of letting everyone know that they have to be the center of attention, could also be described
                        as "outgoing".

                    <p>Bengal cats are a rare breed of cats who are usually very different from other cat breeds. They
                        are intelligent, very energetic,
                        love needing and affectious - which means they need more of your attention than other breeds.
                        They will demand a great playground
                        at your house to get rid of their excessive energy - which of cause includes you as their
                        personal fool. They are not for
                        inexperienced animal owners.

                    <p>Orange cats are the devils spawn. They are unpredictable in behaviour at any given time. They
                        will change from calm
                        and cuddly to a furry ball of energy equal to a nuclear device in nano seconds. Therefore they
                        are very entertaining
                        but will take no concideration for any losses. Destroyed furniture and lots of cuts on the
                        slaves body included.

                    <p>A black cat - often mistakingly labeled as a bad omen - are just very cuddly, love needing,
                        attention seeking and very skiddish cats.
                        These porperties leave the cat often confused about if it should hide or scream for human
                        interaction.
                        Note: black cats are usually less prone to become sick - a big plus since black cats are also
                        very clumsy.

                    <p>Brittish shorthair cats are calm and balanced cats, their energy level is not as high as with
                        other cats,
                        so their zoomies (A cat usually goes crazy a few times a day - called zoomies) are not as bad.
                        They usually
                        will not engage in harmful interactions since they are calm and balanced. But they will not
                        leave your side.

                    <p>Pure white cats count as the rarest kind of cat and mostly act the opposite of black cats. They
                        are very independed, shy and do not want
                        and need much of your attention. Additionally, they often have gene "defects" like different
                        colored eyes which makes them even more unique.
