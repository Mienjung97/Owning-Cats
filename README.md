## Site Overview <a name="site-overview"></a>

Owning Cats is a website to inform about cats, their traids and attributes. It lists pros and cons of owning cats, some necessary info for possible new owners and gives a guideline about breed specific attributes going along with pictures for visuals. The website also includes a form to ask the user about their ownership status and breed preferences, while signing them up for a (fictional) newsletter.

## Repository problems<a name="previous-repository"></a>

On the last day before submitting, my Gitpod workspace had a bug and I was unsable to continue to code there. Gitpod logged me out of my github account, would not let me sign in again and therefore I was unable to push my commits. To fix the Problem, I opened a new Gitpod codespace, where I was logged in again.

## Planning stage <a name="planning-stage"></a>
### Idea <a name="idea"></a>
- Cats are sometimes deeply misunderstood because of misconceptions about their behaviour
- Since I have owend cats my whole life, I personally know how these animals behave and why people often are afraid
- I want to guide people who are interested about cats to gain some knowledge about their different behaviour
- humor is supposed to be a leading cause since cats are often pure entertainment
### Site Aims <a name="site-aims"></a>
- Give users more insight into different cat breeds
- Help user to decide if they want a cat / get more cats and determin which one 
- Let user participate in a survey about their ownership, preferences and opinion about the website while signing up for a newsletter
### Target Audiences <a name="target-audience"></a>
- Users looking to inform themselves for the first time about cats
- Users who already have cats and want to widen their knowledge
- Users who want to sign up to the "Loving Cats" newsletter
### Site Goals <a name="site-goals"></a>
- I expect that users will find the website visually pleasing and easy to navigate 
- The user is supposed to get the information they are looking for easy and quick
- The humor used in the website is supposed to make the user more interested to read the content and engage with the survey
### How will I achieve my Goals <a name="how-i-will-achieve-my-goals"></a>
- With nice contrast colors and background colors for each written text will make navigation easier
- Media queries will make the website fully responsive, so any user will immediately find the content they are looking for
- Humor and cute cat pictures are supposted to keep the user engaged
### Site Structure <a name="site-structure"></a>
The website is structured into three pages, the homepage on which you will recieve general information about cats, an attributes page, which shows pictures of 9 different cat breeds and their usual behaviour and a survey about current ownership, future plans and preferences as a last page. The survey is set up to sign the user up for a fictional Newsletter as well.
### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a> 
The wireframes for Wawas Woods were produced in Balsamiq. There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

### Color scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>
For the webpage I have used orange, white, grey and black colors. the following pictures show all individual colors I have used:

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

### Honorable mentions <a name="honorable-mentions"></a>
I have to thank my dear partner for being so patient since there is not a lot of free time and yet she fully supports me on a daily basis. <br>
I am also thankful for my co-student Marceillo, who I worked closly together and helped me in times of questioning. <br>
A big thank you goes out to the Tutors who have helped me along my first protfolio project: Alan and John helped me understand some problems, helped with technical problems and guided me towards a correct code. 

### General reference: <a name="general-reference"></a>
The biggest help and inspiration in my first project was my Mentor Akshat Garg who helped me a lot with understanding .parent - .child connections, how to implement them in a long css code and media queries. <br>
For the Header (Drop down menu) i took great inspiration from the "Love Running" project, the Footer has been compleatly copied since I really liked the design. Only for bigger screens, the Icons for the social media platforms move closer together. <br>
For creating this readme, I have used example readme files from [Ewan Colquhoun](https://github.com/EwanColquhoun) and my colleague [Marceillo](https://github.com/Marceillo) for the general overview.
