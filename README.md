# Owning Cats

Welcome to my homepage [Owning cats](https://mienjung97.github.io/Owning-Cats/index.html)

## Site Overview <a name="site-overview"></a>

Owning Cats is a website to inform about cats, their traids and attributes. It lists pros and cons of owning cats, some necessary info for possible new owners and gives a guideline about breed specific attributes going along with pictures for visuals. The website also includes a form to ask the user about their ownership status and breed preferences, while signing them up for a (fictional) newsletter.

## Repository problems<a name="problems"></a>

On the last day before submitting, my Gitpod workspace had a bug and I was unsable to continue to code there. Gitpod logged me out of my github account, would not let me sign in again and therefore I was unable to push my commits. To fix the Problem, I opened a new Gitpod codespace, where I was logged in again.

## Planning stage
### Idea:
- Cats are sometimes deeply misunderstood because of misconceptions about their behaviour
- Since I have owend cats my whole life, I personally know how these animals behave and why people often are afraid
- I want to guide people who are interested about cats to gain some knowledge about their different behaviour
- humor is supposed to be a leading cause since cats are often pure entertainment
### Site Aims:
- Give users more insight into different cat breeds
- Help user to decide if they want a cat / get more cats and determin which one 
- Let user participate in a survey about their ownership, preferences and opinion about the website while signing up for a newsletter
### Target Audiences:
- Users looking to inform themselves for the first time about cats
- Users who already have cats and want to widen their knowledge
- Users who want to sign up to the "Loving Cats" newsletter
### Site Goals:
- I expect that users will find the website visually pleasing and easy to navigate 
- The user is supposed to get the information they are looking for easy and quick
- The humor used in the website is supposed to make the user more interested to read the content and engage with the survey
### How will I achieve my Goals
