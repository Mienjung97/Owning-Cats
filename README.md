## Site Overview <a name="site-overview"></a>

Owning Cats is a website to inform about cats, their traids and attributes. It lists pros and cons of owning cats, some necessary info for possible new owners and gives a guideline about breed specific attributes going along with pictures for visuals. The website also includes a form to ask the user about their ownership status and breed preferences, while signing them up for a (fictional) newsletter.

## Repository problems<a name="previous-repository"></a>

On the last day before submitting, my Gitpod workspace had a bug and I was unsable to continue to code there. Gitpod logged me out of my github account, would not let me sign in again and therefore I was unable to push my commits. To fix the Problem, I opened a new Gitpod codespace, where I was logged in again.

- Cats are sometimes deeply misunderstood because of misconceptions about their behaviour
- Since I have owend cats my whole life, I personally know how these animals behave and why people often are afraid
- I want to guide people who are interested about cats to gain some knowledge about their different behaviour

## Site Structure <a name="site-structure"></a>
The website is structured into three pages, the homepage on which you will recieve general information about cats, an attributes page, which shows pictures of 9 different cat breeds and their usual behaviour and a survey about current ownership, future plans and preferences as a last page. The survey is set up to sign the user up for a fictional Newsletter as well.


## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a> 
The wireframes for Wawas Woods were produced in Balsamiq. There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Typography <a name="typography"></a>

# Features <a name="features"></a>

## Navigation menu <a name="navigation-menu"></a>
- The Navigation menu was created with the help of the Love Running project, features a burger-icon drop-down-menu for smaller screens up to 992px, after which it will transform to a horizontal list. The Navigation bar has an indicator, on which side the user currently is on and will alsway redirect the user back to the homepage, as soon as they click the "Owning Cats" text in the header.

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

### Honorable mentions <a name="honorable-mentions"></a>
I have to thank my dear partner for being so patient since there is not a lot of free time and yet she fully supports me on a daily basis. <br>
I am also thankful for my co-student Marceillo, who I worked closly together and helped me in times of questioning. <br>
A big thank you goes out to the Tutors who have helped me along my first protfolio project: Alan and John helped me understand some problems, helped with technical problems and guided me towards a correct code.

### General reference: <a name="general-reference"></a>
The biggest help and inspiration in my first project was my Mentor Akshat Garg who helped me a lot with understanding .parent - .child connections, how to implement them in a long css code and media queries. <br>
For the Header (Drop down menu) i took great inspiration from the "Love Running" project, the Footer has been compleatly copied since I really liked the design. Only for bigger screens, the Icons for the social media platforms move closer together. <br>
For creating this readme, I have used example readme files from [Ewan Colquhoun](https://github.com/EwanColquhoun) and my colleague [Marceillo](https://github.com/Marceillo) for the general overview.
